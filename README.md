Partially-Connected Hybrid Beamforming for Spectral Efficiency Maximization via a Weighted MMSE Equivalence


The Matlab Simulation codes for Partially-Connected Hybrid Beamforming for Spectral Efficiency Maximization via a Weighted MMSE Equivalence. Please refer to link https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.04537 for the pre-printed version. If these codes is help for your work, you can choose to cite the paper, but is not necessary.


The code of the SDR-based algorithm in this paper can refer to link https://github.com/yuxianghao/Alternating-minimization-algorithms-for-hybrid-precoding-in-millimeter-wave-MIMO-systems


# How to use
1. You first need to run Fixed_channel.m in folder named Channel_data to generate random channels, the default setting is 100 times
2. Then, you should totally add all packages to the path, so you can use these functions. Then, just run the main_snr.m file directly.

# Content
This codes including several algorithms mentioned in my paper, all can easily cited by these convenient APIs.

# End
I won't update it recently because of limitation of time. However, if you have any problems, you can directly contact me by e-mail: xingyuzhao19@fudan.edu.cn, I'm glad to help you.
